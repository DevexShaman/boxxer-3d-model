your useMeshReady function expects scene as the third parameter, but inside TextDecal and ImageDecal you are calling it without scene. That means the hook cannot perform the canonical scene lookup (scene.getObjectByProperty / scene.getObjectByName) and will often return null (so readyMesh stays falsy → you delay render → Drei eventually throws when something mounts incorrectly).

Fixing those two calls fixes the mismatch almost every time.

Quick fix — two one-line changes

In both TextDecal and ImageDecal replace:

// old (missing scene)
const readyMesh = useMeshReady(meshMap, decal);


with:

// new — pass the canonical scene
const readyMesh = useMeshReady(meshMap, decal, scene);


You have scene available because you're already passing it into DecalInstance and from there into TextDecal/ImageDecal. After this change the hook will look up the renderer’s canonical mesh instance via scene.getObjectByProperty('uuid', ...) / scene.getObjectByName(...) (as written in your hook) and return that exact mesh instance — which Drei expects.

Extra small robustness improvements (optional, recommended)

Defensive early-return — at top of useMeshReady effect, return early if !scene:

if (!scene) return;


Log the chosen mesh right after setReadyMesh(found) so you can confirm identity:

console.debug('[DecalSystem] readyMesh set for', decal.id, found.name || found.uuid);


Confirm identity mismatch: your hook already logs when meshMap entry !== scene entry. Watch for that log — if it appears, prefer using the scene result (you already do).

Alternative canonical source: if you still see issues, get the canonical scene inside DecalSystem itself (via const { scene: canonicalScene } = useThree();) and use that instead of an external scene prop — minimizes accidental different scene references.
