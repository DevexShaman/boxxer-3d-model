You are a senior Three.js / WebGL lighting and PBR rendering expert specializing in product configurators and fabric rendering.

Current Issue

The 3D model looks correct from some angles, but from other angles:

Parts of the model turn whitish / overexposed

Highlights blow out when rotating the model

Lighting is directional instead of uniform

Fabric detail disappears at certain angles

This happens during full 360° rotation of the model.

🎯 Final Goal

Create a uniform, physically correct studio lighting setup that:

Looks consistent from all 360° angles

Prevents overexposure at grazing angles

Preserves fabric texture, roughness, and weave

Uses soft, realistic shadows

Feels like a professional e-commerce product viewer

No angle should look brighter than the others.

🔍 What You Must Fix & Implement
1️⃣ Replace Directional-Dominant Lighting with Balanced Studio Lighting

You must avoid relying on a single key light.

Instead:

Use multiple low-intensity area-style lights

Balance light contribution from all sides

No light should exceed realistic intensity values

Target:

Even illumination

Controlled highlights

No hotspot glare

2️⃣ Environment Lighting Normalization (Critical)

The HDRI environment must:

Be neutral studio HDR

Have low contrast

Use moderate intensity

Never dominate the lighting alone

You must:

Normalize environment contribution

Prevent reflection spikes from HDR hotspots

3️⃣ Light Rig for 360° Stability

Create a 4-point soft studio rig:

Front soft fill

Back rim (very subtle)

Left & right soft balance lights

Optional overhead ambient soft light

Each light must:

Have low intensity

Cast soft shadows

Be positioned to avoid specular stacking

4️⃣ Shadows (Realism Without Darkness)

Implement:

Contact shadows or soft shadows

Shadow bias tuning

No pitch-black shadows

Shadows must anchor the object, not overpower it

5️⃣ Renderer & Exposure Locking

You MUST:

Lock exposure (no auto-exposure)

Use ACES Filmic tone mapping

Clamp highlights using realistic exposure

Enable physicallyCorrectLights

Prevent:

Angle-based brightness variation

Specular blowouts

6️⃣ Material Safety Controls (Fabric-Specific)

For cloth materials:

Clamp roughness (never < 0.35)

Metalness always ≈ 0

Normal scale kept subtle

Optional sheen with low intensity

Ensure:

Lighting does not amplify specular reflections unnaturally

Minimal but professional setup

If done correctly:

Rotating the model should feel like rotating it inside a soft studio light box, not under moving spotlights.
