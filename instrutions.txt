You are a senior 3D web engineer with deep expertise in Three.js, React Three Fiber, GLTF workflows, and PBR materials.

I am building a 3D product customization system using:

React

React Three Fiber

@react-three/drei

Three.js

GLB (glTF) models

Redux for state

PBR material workflow

Current Situation

I already have a .glb model with separate meshes per part.

Color customization on meshes works correctly.

I now want to apply fabric images so that:

The texture pattern

The fabric color

And the cloth surface look

appear as close as possible to the reference image selected by the user.

The images show real cloth/fabric (woven patterns, fibers, shading), and when selected, the same fabric should appear on the target mesh — not just as a flat sticker or decal, but as a realistic material.

Problem

Despite loading the texture images and assigning them to map, normalMap, and roughnessMap, the fabric on the 3D model:

Does NOT visually match the reference image

Looks flat, washed out, incorrect in color, or unrealistic

Does not preserve the original fabric tone or depth

Existing Code Context

Textures are applied using useTexture

MeshStandardMaterial is used

map, normalMap, and roughnessMap are assigned

color is reset to white

metalness = 0, roughness = 1

flipY = false

SRGBColorSpace is set

Texture repeat, rotation, and anisotropy are applied

Yet the final appearance is still wrong.

What I want from you

Analyze this setup and explain WHY the fabric image does not visually match the reference, and explain HOW TO FIX IT PROPERLY, covering:

1️⃣ Conceptual Mistakes

Why a single fabric image cannot automatically become a realistic cloth material

Difference between:

Image texture

Albedo/BaseColor

Normal map

Roughness map

Fabric weave depth

Why decals and textures are not the same thing

2️⃣ PBR Workflow Issues

What is missing when only an image is used

Why correct fabric appearance requires multiple texture maps

How lighting, roughness, and normals affect perceived color

Why lighting makes the fabric look “wrong” even if the image is correct

3️⃣ GLTF + Three.js Specific Issues

Color space mismatches

Tone mapping and exposure issues

Gamma correction pitfalls

Why setting roughness to 1 can destroy fabric realism

When normalScale can ruin cloth look

4️⃣ Correct Fabric Texture Pipeline

Explain the correct production-grade approach:

How fabric images should be converted into:

BaseColor

Normal

Roughness

(Optional) Ambient Occlusion

When to preprocess textures outside the app

Why AI texture generation or Substance-style workflows are needed

5️⃣ What SHOULD be done instead

Explain the correct solution, such as:

Pre-creating real fabric PBR texture sets

Mapping fabric IDs → PBR texture packs

Avoiding runtime “magic fabric generation”

Treating fabric selection as material swapping, not image mapping

6️⃣ Dos and Don’ts

Clearly list:

❌ What should NOT be attempted

✅ What is the correct industry practice

⚠️ Performance and memory pitfalls

⚠️ What beginners usually get wrong

Important Constraints

I will NOT modify the GLB in Blender

I receive the GLB from a senior and must use it as-is

Fabric images come from UI selection

The goal is realistic cloth appearance, not decals

This is for a production e-commerce product customizer

Final Goal

Help me fully understand:

Why my current approach cannot work as expected

What the correct mental model is

How to architect fabric customization correctly

How to fix the issue without hacks or visual cheats

Explain clearly, step by step, in a beginner-friendly but production-grade way.
